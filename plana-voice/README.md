# LiveKit Agents Starter - Python

A complete starter project for building voice AI apps with [LiveKit Agents for Python](https://github.com/livekit/agents) and [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/).

This project is configured for a direct Gemini Live connection: LiveKit carries the
browser's realtime audio and dispatches the agent, while the Python worker connects
to Google's Gemini API with `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. It does not use LiveKit Inference for
speech-to-text, language-model, or text-to-speech processing.

The project includes:

- A Plan A voice agent using Gemini Live's native audio input, output, and turn detection.
- A focused test suite that checks the direct-provider configuration without calling a
  live model.
- A Dockerfile ready for [production deployment to LiveKit Cloud](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/agents/).

This starter app is compatible with any [custom web/mobile frontend](https://docs.livekit.io/frontends/) or [telephony](https://docs.livekit.io/telephony/).

## Using coding agents

This project is designed to work with coding agents like [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/).

For your convenience, LiveKit offers both a CLI and an [MCP server](https://docs.livekit.io/reference/developer-tools/docs-mcp/) that can be used to browse and search its documentation. The [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/intro/basics/cli/) (`lk docs`) works with any coding agent that can run shell commands. Install it for your platform:

**macOS:**

```console
brew install livekit-cli
```

**Linux:**

```console
curl -sSL https://get.livekit.io/cli | bash
```

**Windows:**

```console
winget install LiveKit.LiveKitCLI
```

The `lk docs` subcommand requires version 2.15.0 or higher. Check your version with `lk --version` and update if needed. Once installed, your coding agent can search and browse LiveKit documentation directly from the terminal:

```console
lk docs search "voice agents"
lk docs get-page /agents/start/voice-ai-quickstart
```

See the [Using coding agents](https://docs.livekit.io/intro/coding-agents/) guide for more details, including MCP server setup.

The project includes a complete [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) file for these assistants. You can modify this file to suit your needs. To learn more about this file, see [https://agents.md](https://agents.md).

## Dev Setup

### Gemini Live configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set all of the following values:

- `LIVEKIT_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, and `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` for the LiveKit room
  and agent worker.
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for the direct Gemini Live connection. Keep this key in the
  Python worker's environment only; do not add it to the frontend.
- Optionally, set `GEMINI_LIVE_MODEL` and `GEMINI_LIVE_VOICE` to override the
  default native-audio model and voice.

When deploying the worker, configure `GOOGLE_API_KEY` as a worker secret alongside
the LiveKit credentials.

### Trip context and itinerary edits

Plan A receives the current trip through a short-lived LiveKit room dispatch, then
uses the existing `plana-be` LangGraph/Supabase backend to read and validate a
requested itinerary change. The worker never receives a Supabase key.

Set `PLANA_VOICE_AGENT_SECRET` to the same value in both `plana-be/.env` and the
voice worker environment. Set `PLANA_BACKEND_URL` in the worker environment:

- `PLANA_VOICE_AGENT_SECRET`: one shared, private server-to-server secret.
- `PLANA_BACKEND_URL`: the worker-visible base URL for `plana-be` (for example,
  `http://127.0.0.1:8000` during local development).

Keep `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (or the existing backend-only `SUPABASE_SK`)
in `plana-be` only. When Plan A successfully reschedules an activity or meal, the
backend saves it, validates it with the existing planning rules, and the worker sends
a compact revision signal over the LiveKit room. The browser then refetches and
renders the saved itinerary immediately without interrupting the voice room.

### Voice isolation

The worker applies ai-coustics Voice Focus 2.1 S (`QUAIL_VF_S`) to incoming browser
audio through LiveKit Cloud before it reaches Gemini Live. It is designed to keep a
dominant, near-field speaker clear when nearby voices or environmental noise are
present. No additional ai-coustics key is needed with LiveKit Cloud, but Voice Focus
has an additional LiveKit usage cost. Do not add a second enhanced noise-cancellation
model in the browser; LiveKit recommends filtering the audio in only one place.

Create a project from this template with the LiveKit CLI (recommended):

```bash
lk cloud auth
lk agent init my-agent --template agent-starter-python
```

The CLI clones the template and configures your environment. Then follow the rest of this guide from [Run the agent](#run-the-agent).

<details>
<summary>Alternative: Manual setup without the CLI</summary>

Clone the repository and install dependencies to a virtual environment:

```console
cd agent-starter-python
uv sync
```

Sign up for [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/) then set up the environment by copying `.env.example` to `.env.local` and filling in the required keys:

- `LIVEKIT_URL`
- `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`
- `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`

You can load the LiveKit environment automatically using the [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/intro/basics/cli/):

```bash
lk cloud auth
lk app env --write --destination .env.local
```

</details>

## Run the agent

Run this command to speak to your agent directly in your terminal:

```console
uv run python src/agent.py console
```

To run the agent for use with a frontend or telephony, use the `dev` command:

```console
uv run python src/agent.py dev
```

In production, use the `start` command:

```console
uv run python src/agent.py start
```

## Frontend & Telephony

For advanced customization, see the [complete frontend guide](https://docs.livekit.io/frontends/).

## Tests and evals

This project includes a complete suite of evals, based on the LiveKit Agents [testing & evaluation framework](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/testing/). To run them, use `pytest`.

```console
uv run pytest
```

## Using this template repo for your own project

Once you've started your own project based on this repo, you should:

1. **Check in your `uv.lock`**: This file is currently untracked for the template, but you should commit it to your repository for reproducible builds and proper configuration management. (The same applies to `livekit.toml`, if you run your agents in LiveKit Cloud)

2. **Remove the git tracking test**: Delete the "Check files not tracked in git" step from `.github/workflows/tests.yml` since you'll now want this file to be tracked. These are just there for development purposes in the template repo itself.

3. **Add your own repository secrets**: You must [add secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/using-secrets-in-github-actions) for `LIVEKIT_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, and `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` so that the tests can run in CI.

## Deploying to production

This project is production-ready and includes a working `Dockerfile`. To deploy it to LiveKit Cloud or another environment, see the [deploying to production](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/agents/) guide.

## Self-hosted LiveKit

You can also self-host LiveKit instead of using LiveKit Cloud. See the [self-hosting](https://docs.livekit.io/transport/self-hosting/local/) guide for more information. If you choose to self-host, you'll need to also use [model plugins](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/#plugins) instead of LiveKit Inference and will need to remove the [LiveKit Cloud noise cancellation](https://docs.livekit.io/transport/media/noise-cancellation/) plugin.
